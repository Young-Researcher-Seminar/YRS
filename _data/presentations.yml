  abstract: The weak optimal transport is a generalization of OT with multiple applications. However the lack of structure renders it harder to compute. We propose to study methods of computation.

    Isentropic Euler equations: uniqueness and vacuum
  type: long
  authors: Animesh JANA
  abstract: |
    The motion of a compressible non-viscous fluid is governed by the Euler equations. In multi dimension, the well-posedness of entropy solution is an open question. We discuss the uniqueness of Hölder continuous solution in the set of weak solutions satisfying entropy conditions. To prove the uniqueness, we impose (i) 1/2 Hölder regularity and (ii) a one-sided Lipschitz bound condition on velocity. We further show the weak-strong uniqueness for the isentropic Euler system when the strong solution may contain a vacuum region. To prove the uniqueness result for the vacuum case, we assume an integrability condition on reciprocal of the density function. This talk will be based on the following two articles [1, 2].

     Vicsek-Kuramoto third order system in collective dynamics and their macroscopic equations
  type: long
  authors: Carmela MOSCHELLA (University of Vienna), joint work with Sara Merino ACEITUNO
  abstract: |
    In this talk we consider an Individual-Based Model for self-propelled particles interacting through local alignment and investigate its macroscopic limit. This model has been first introduced by C. Chen et al. to describe the behaviour of dense colony of flagellated bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli) which self organize into robust collective oscillatory motion. In view of this, a ’Vicsek- Kuramoto style’ model has been used. The agent based model combines both Kuramoto and Vicsek dynamics - it takes from Kuramoto model the way in which agents try to syncronize the phase of their rotational movement and from the Vicsek model the fact that the syncronization is spacially local. We study the mean-field kinetic and hydrodynamic limits of this system. Due to the lack of energy and momentum preservation in the system, we use the notion of gen- eralized collisional invariant to obtain a closed set of macroscopic equation for the model. The final macroscopic model involves a continuity equation for the total density of particles, a non conservative equation for angular momentum density and a non conservative equation for the direction of the mean velocity.

     Asymptotics of random characteristic polynomials
  type: long
  authors: Quentin FRANCOIS
  abstract: |
    In this talk, I will present recent results on the convergence of the reciprocal characteristic polynomial for Girko matrices as a random holomorphic function. This result is a universality result as the limiting object only depends on the second moment of the entries of the matrix. After exposing the techniques used in the proof, I will point out a continuation of this work in the context of Elliptic Ginibre matrices.

     An Introduction to Self-Supervised Learning
  type: long
  authors: Nicolas MAKAROFF
  abstract: |
    The presentation is a comprehensive introduction to Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), focusing on its key methods: Contrastive Learning, Self-Distillation, and Correlation Methods. The growing importance of SSL in leveraging unlabeled data for representation learning is underscored. We explore Contrastive Learning's theoretical underpinnings, distinguishing between positive and negative samples, and its successful implementations. Self-Distillation's knowledge propagation between teacher-student networks, even without label information, is examined, alongside its current applications and theoretical foundations. Next, we investigate Correlation Methods, which use statistical relationships within data for learning, providing a theoretical analysis of their effectiveness and limitations. In conclusion, the presentation aims to provide a introductory theoretical understanding of SSL.
