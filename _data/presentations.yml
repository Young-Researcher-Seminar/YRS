  abstract: "The motion of a compressible non-viscous fluid is governed by the Euler equations. In multi dimension, the well-posedness of entropy solution is an open question. We discuss the uniqueness of H ̈older continuous solution in the set of weak solutions satisfying entropy conditions. To prove the uniqueness, we impose (i) 1/2 H ̈older regularity and (ii) a one-sided Lipschitz bound condition on velocity. We further show the weak-strong uniqueness for the isentropic Euler system when the strong solution may contain a vacuum region. To prove the uniqueness result for the vacuum case, we assume an integrability condition on reciprocal of the density function. This talk will be based on the following two articles [1, 2].
