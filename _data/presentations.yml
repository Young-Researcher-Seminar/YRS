    Isentropic Euler equations: uniqueness and vacuum
  type: long
  authors: Animesh JANA
  abstract: |
    The motion of a compressible non-viscous fluid is governed by the Euler equations. In multi dimension, the well-posedness of entropy solution is an open question. We discuss the uniqueness of Hölder continuous solution in the set of weak solutions satisfying entropy conditions. To prove the uniqueness, we impose (i) 1/2 Hölder regularity and (ii) a one-sided Lipschitz bound condition on velocity. We further show the weak-strong uniqueness for the isentropic Euler system when the strong solution may contain a vacuum region. To prove the uniqueness result for the vacuum case, we assume an integrability condition on reciprocal of the density function. This talk will be based on the following two articles [1, 2].

     Vicsek-Kuramoto third order system in collective dynamics and their macroscopic equations

    In this talk we consider an Individual-Based Model for self-propelled particles interacting through local alignment and investigate its macroscopic limit. This model has been first introduced by C. Chen et al. to describe the behaviour of dense colony of flagellated bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli) which self organize into robust collective oscillatory motion. In view of this, a ’Vicsek- Kuramoto style’ model has been used. The agent based model combines both Kuramoto and Vicsek dynamics - it takes from Kuramoto model the way in which agents try to syncronize the phase of their rotational movement and from the Vicsek model the fact that the syncronization is spacially local. We study the mean-field kinetic and hydrodynamic limits of this system. Due to the lack of energy and momentum preservation in the system, we use the notion of gen- eralized collisional invariant to obtain a closed set of macroscopic equation for the model. The final macroscopic model involves a continuity equation for the total density of particles, a non conservative equation for angular momentum density and a non conservative equation for the direction of the mean velocity.

     Asymptotics of random characteristic polynomials
  type: short
  authors: Quentin FRANCOIS
  abstract: |
    In this talk, I will present recent results on the convergence of the reciprocal characteristic polynomial for Girko matrices as a random holomorphic function. This result is a universality result as the limiting object only depends on the second moment of the entries of the matrix. After exposing the techniques used in the proof, I will point out a continuation of this work in the context of Elliptic Ginibre matrices.

     An Introduction to Self-Supervised Learning
  type: long
  authors: Nicolas MAKAROFF
  abstract: |
    The presentation is a comprehensive introduction to Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), focusing on its key methods: Contrastive Learning, Self-Distillation, and Correlation Methods. The growing importance of SSL in leveraging unlabeled data for representation learning is underscored. We explore Contrastive Learning's theoretical underpinnings, distinguishing between positive and negative samples, and its successful implementations. Self-Distillation's knowledge propagation between teacher-student networks, even without label information, is examined, alongside its current applications and theoretical foundations. Next, we investigate Correlation Methods, which use statistical relationships within data for learning, providing a theoretical analysis of their effectiveness and limitations. In conclusion, the presentation aims to provide a introductory theoretical understanding of SSL.

     Multi-Marginal Entropic Martingale Optimal Transport and applications to the calibration of Stochastic Processes
  type: long
  authors: Guillaume CHAZAREIX
  abstract: |
    Martingale Optimal Transport has found extensive applications in various financial contexts, particularly in the calibration of stochastic processes. The numerical solutions for this problem involve tackling a variational problem that entails non-linear partial differential equations. In this presentation, we delve into a discretization approach for the continuous problem and introduce a relaxation technique by incorporating an entropy term. This relaxation enables the utilization of algorithms analogous to those employed in classical entropic optimal transport. Moreover, we outline potential methodologies for implementing this algorithm on a GPU platform, thereby enhancing computational efficiency.

    Non-decreasing martingale coupling
  type: long
  authors: Kexin SHAO
  abstract: |
    Martingale optimal transport is considered adding an additional martingale constraint to the traditional optimal transport problem.
    The traditional optimal transport problem (OT) consists in minimizing the expected cost $\mathbb{E}[c(X_1, X_2)]$ by considering the joint distribution $(\mu,\nu)$ where the marginal distributions of the random variables $X_1 \sim \mu$ and $X_2 \sim \nu $ are fixed. Motivated by financial applications, martingale optimal transport is considered adding an additional martingale constraint $\mathbb{E}[ X_2 \vert X_1] = X_1$ on top of the OT problem. Hobson and Neuberger first studied the problem with the specific cost function $c(x, y) = −\vert y – x\vert$, Juillet and Beiglbock proved the uniqueness of the associated optimizer $\pi^{\rm HN}$ when $\mu$ is continuous. We observe numerically that the $\pi^{\rm HN}$ is still a maximizer for $\rho\in(0,2)$ and a minimizer for $\rho>2$. We investigate the theoretical validity of this numerical observation and give rather restrictive sufficient conditions for the property to hold. We also exhibit couples $(\mu,\nu)$ such that it does not hold. $\pi^{\rm HN}$ is known to satisfy some monotonicity property which we call non-decreasing. We check that the non-decreasing property is preserved for maximizers when $\rho\in(0,1]$. In general, there exist distinct non-decreasing martingale couplings, and we find some decomposition of $\nu$ which is in one-to-one correspondence with couplings in a non-decreasing sense.

     L2 Hypocoercivity methods for kinetic Fokker-Planck equations with factorised Gibbs states
  type: long
  authors: Luca ZIVIANI
  abstract: |
    This contribution deals with L2 hypocoercivity methods for kinetic Fokker-Planck equations with inte- grable local equilibria and a factorisation property that relates the Fokker-Planck and the transport operators. Rates of convergence in presence of a global equilibrium, or decay rates otherwise, are estimated either by the corresponding rates in the diffusion limit, or by the rates of convergence to local equilibria, under moment conditions. On the basis of the underlying functional inequalities, we establish a classification of decay and convergence rates for large times, which includes for instance sub-exponential local equilibria and sub-exponential potentials.

     A varitional approach to reforesting
  type: long
  authors: Joao PINTO ANASTACIO MACHADO
  abstract: |
    We will discuss a variational model for the growth of a tree consisting of the maximization of a harvesting term, modelling the nutrients the plant can get from the soil, minus the cost of constructing the roots, modelled by the branched transportation distance between a Dirac measure (base of the trunk) and a measure giving the distribution of micro-filaments of the roots. The nutrients on the soil satisfy a quasilinear elliptic PDE with measure coefficients. Our first step is to prove wellposedness of the model in the form an existence and uniqueness result for this PDE. In the sequel use this model to define a N-player game where each tree is an agent competing for resources selfishly, and a master player has the agency of controlling the distribution of nutrients on the soil and the positions where the trees are planted.

    Regularisation by noise of singular SDEs and the selection problem
  type: long
  authors: Lukasz MADRY
  abstract: |
    We will consider the following class of equations $- \mathrm{d}X = b(X) \mathrm{d}t + \mathrm{d}W$, where b is a singular function, possibly a distribution and W is an irregular noise. The well-posedness of these equations is by now a well-understood phenomenon, which is called regularisation by noise. We will outline recent developments of this theory - in particular, its non-Markovian aspects which allow to investigate the influence of the noise of different regularity than Brownian motion.
    <br/>
    Time permitting, we will also discuss new results on the selection problem, i.e. the limit of $\mathrm{d}X = b(X) \mathrm{d}t + \varepsilon \mathrm{d}W$ where $\varepsilon$ tends to zero.

    Geometry and optimal transportation: Applications to visual generative models
  type: long
  authors: Changqing FU
  abstract: |
    In this talk, we takle the problem of adding geometrical constraints into neural networks for visual generative models. First we reformulate standard neural networks under a variational perspective and introduce the concept of geometry. Then we review major methods including Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, and the constraints to control the generation process, including style, text, or other forms of signals. Finally we contribute several practical solutions using geometry and optimal transportation, involving convolution, activation, perceptual distance, with an emphasis on the description of the attention funcion which is recent breakthrough in machine learning.
